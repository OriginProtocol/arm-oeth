/// @notice Central registry for deployed contracts and execution history during deployments.

///      - Stores addresses of deployed contracts for cross-script lookups
///      - Tracks which deployment scripts have been executed to prevent re-runs
///      - Deployed via vm.etch at a deterministic address for consistent access

///      1. DeployManager loads existing data from JSON into Resolver (_preDeployment)
///      2. Deployment scripts query Resolver for previously deployed addresses
///      3. Deployment scripts register new contracts and mark themselves as executed
///      4. DeployManager saves Resolver data back to JSON (_postDeployment)
