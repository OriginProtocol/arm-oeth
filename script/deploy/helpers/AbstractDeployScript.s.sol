/// @title AbstractDeployScript
/// @notice Base abstract contract for orchestrating smart contract deployments.
/// @dev This contract standardizes the deployment workflow by providing:
///      - Consistent execution lifecycle across all deployment scripts
///      - Automatic contract address persistence to the Resolver
///      - Governance proposal building and simulation
///      - Fork testing support with vm.prank instead of vm.broadcast
///
///      Inheritance Pattern:
///      Each deployment script inherits from this contract and implements:
///      - _execute(): The main deployment logic (optional)
///      - _buildGovernanceProposal(): Define governance actions (optional)
///      - _fork(): Post-deployment fork testing logic (optional)
///      - skip(): Return true to skip this script (optional)
///      - proposalExecuted(): Return true if governance already executed (optional)
///
///      Execution Flow (run()):
///      1. Get state from Resolver
///      2. Load deployer address from environment
///      3. Start broadcast/prank based on state
///      4. Execute _execute() - child contract's deployment logic
///      5. Stop broadcast/prank
///      6. Store deployed contracts in Resolver
///      7. Build and handle governance proposal
///      8. Run _fork() for additional fork testing
